"# taskSession9" 
Write a JavaScript program that:

Defines an array of student grades (numbers from 0 to 100).

Creates a function getAverage(grades) that:

Uses a loop to calculate the sum of grades.

Uses control flow (if / else) to check if the average is passing (≥ 50) or failing (< 50).

Creates another function filterPassed(grades) that uses an array built-in function (filter) to return only grades ≥ 50.

Creates another function doubleGrades(grades) that uses an array built-in function (map) to increase each grade by 10 (but max is 100).

Calls all functions and prints results.
